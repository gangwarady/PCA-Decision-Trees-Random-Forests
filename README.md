# PCA-Decision-Trees-Random-Forests

The dataset we used in the previous section had just two numeric attributes. In this section we will look at a slightly sophisticated dataset having a mix of numeric and categorical attributes describing an adult. The dataset can be downloaded from UCI Machine Learning repository. The task is to predict whether the person defined by the given set of attributes earns more than 50000 or less (Binary classification task). Implement the following and state your results with respect to this dataset. 
1. Implement the decision tree algorithm to classify whether the income of a particular user exceeds $50K per year or not. Divide the data into two sets: Training set (80%) and validation set (20%). Plot the training error and validation error against the number of nodes present in the decision tree. Describe the optimal decision tree in your video. [15 Marks]
2. Create 10 datasets using bootstrap technique and rerun the part 1 to find the optimal decision tree for each of these datasets. Report the final error by taking the average of each decision tree and report your findings. Did the performance improved? [10 Marks]
3. Implement PCA to find optimal number of features. Plot the error of optimal decision tree against the number of features. How many features did it require to match the performance of the tree obtained in the first part. [10 Marks]
